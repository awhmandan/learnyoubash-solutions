LOOPS (Exercise 9 of 11)  
   
Here we wont be surprised. As in any programming language, a loop in bash  
is a block of code that iterates as long as the control conditional is  
true.  
 
There are four types of loops in Bash: for, while, until and select.  
 
### for loop  
 
The for is very similar to its sibling in C. It looks like this:  
 
   for arg in elem1 elem2 ... elemN  
   do  
     # statements  
   done  
 
During each pass through the loop, arg takes on the value from elem1 to  
elemN. Values may also be wildcards or [brace  
expansion](#brace-expansion).  
 
Also, we can write for loop in one line, but in this case there needs to  
be a semicolon before do, like below:  
 
   for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done  
 
By the way, if for..in..do seems a little bit weird to you, you can also  
write for in C-like style such as:  
 
   for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do  
     echo $i  
   done  
 
for is handy when we want to do the same operation over each file in a  
directory. For example, if we need to move all .bash files into script  
folder and then give them execute permissions, our script would look like  
this:  
 
   #!/bin/bash  
     
   for FILE in $HOME/*.bash; do  
     mv "$FILE" "${HOME}/scripts"  
     chmod +x "${HOME}/scripts/${FILE}"  
   done  
 
### while loop  
 
The while loop tests a condition and loops a sequence of commands so long  
as that condition is true. A condition is nothing more than primary is  
used in if..then conditions. So a working example with while loop might  
look like this:  
 
   #!/bin/bash  
     
   # Squares of numbers from 0 through 9  
   x=0  
   while [[ $x -lt 10 ]]; do # value of x is less than 10  
     echo $(($x * $x))  
     x=`expr $x + 1` # increase x  
   done  
 
Just like in the case of the for loop, if we want to write do and  
condition in the same line, then we must use a semicolon before do.  
 
### until loop  
 
The until loop is the exact opposite of the while loop. Like a while it  
checks a test condition, but it keeps looping as long as this condition is  
false:  
 
   until [[ condition ]]; do  
     #statements  
   done  
 
### Loop control  
 
There are situations when we need to stop a loop before its normal ending  
or step over an iteration. In these cases, we can use the shell built-in  
break and continue statements. Both of these work with every kind of loop.  
 
The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its ending. We  
have already met with it.  
 
The continue statement steps over one iteration. We can use it as such:  
 
   for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do  
     if [[ $(($i % 2)) == 0 ]]; then continue; fi  
     echo $i  
   done  
 
If we run the example above, it will print all odd numbers from 0 through  
9.  
 
## THE CHALLENGE  
 
Create a file named loops.bash.  
 
The first two positional parameters which will be passed into your script  
are the limits. You should write all even numbers in range between the  
first and second positional parameters.  
 
Example:  
 
   ./loops.bash 10 17  
 
Output:  
 
   10  
   12  
   14  
   16  
 
Use for, while or until loop to solve this problem. 

#####################
  
In description of problem we havent told about select loop.  
   
The select loop helps us to organize a user menu. It has almost the same  
syntax as for loop:  
 
   select answer in elem1 elem2 ... elemN  
   do  
     # statements  
   done  
 
The select prints all elem1..elemN on the screen with their sequence  
numbers, after that it prompts the user. Usually it looks like $? (PS3  
variable). The answer will save in answer. If answer is the number between  
1..N, then statements will execute and select will go to the next  
iteration â€” thats because we should use break statement.  
 
A working example might look like this:  
 
   #!/bin/bash  
     
   PS3="Choose the package manager: "  
   select ITEM in bower npm gem pip  
   do  
     echo -n "Enter the package name: " && read PACKAGE  
     case $ITEM in  
       bower) bower install $PACKAGE ;;  
       npm)   npm   install $PACKAGE ;;  
       gem)   gem   install $PACKAGE ;;  
       pip)   pip   install $PACKAGE ;;  
     esac  
     break # avoid infinite loop  
   done  
 
This example, asks the user what package manager to use. Then, it will ask  
what package we want to install and finally proceed to install it.  
 
If we run this, we will get:  
 
   $ ./my_script  
   1) bower  
   2) npm  
   3) gem  
   4) pip  
   Choose the package manager: 2  
   Enter the package name: bash-handbook  
   <installing bash-handbook>
